# ElevenLabs React Library

An SDK library for using ElevenLabs in React based applications. If you're looking for a Node.js library, please refer to the [ElevenLabs Node.js Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elevenlabs).

> Note that this library is launching to primarily support Conversational AI. The support for speech synthesis and other more generic use cases is planned for the future.

# or
yarn add @elevenlabs/react
# or
pnpm install @elevenlabs/react
```

## Usage

### useConversation

React hook for managing WebSocket and WebRTC connections and audio usage for ElevenLabs Conversational AI.

#### Initialize conversation

First, initialize the Conversation instance.

```tsx
const conversation = useConversation();
```

Note that Conversational AI requires microphone access.
Consider explaining and allowing microphone access in your apps UI before the Conversation kicks off. The microphone may also be blocked for the current page by default, resulting in the allow prompt not showing up at all. You should handle such use case in your application and display appropriate message to the user:

```js
// call after explaning to the user why the microphone access is needed
// handle errors and show appropriate message to the user
try {
  await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia();
} catch {
  // handle error
}
```

#### Options

The Conversation can be initialized with certain options. Those are all optional.

```tsx
const conversation = useConversation({
  /* options object */
});
```

- **clientTools** - object definition for client tools that can be invoked by agent. [See below](#client-tools) for details.
- **overrides** - object definition conversations settings overrides. [See below](#conversation-overrides) for details.
- **textOnly** - whether the conversation should run in text-only mode. [See below](#text-only) for details.
- **onConnect** - handler called when the conversation connection is established.
- **onDisconnect** - handler called when the conversation connection has ended.
- **onMessage** - handler called when a new message is received. These can be tentative or final transcriptions of user voice, replies produced by LLM, or debug message when a debug option is enabled.
- **onError** - handler called when a error is encountered.

##### Client Tools

Client tools are a way to enabled agent to invoke client-side functionality. This can be used to trigger actions in the client, such as opening a modal or doing an API call on behalf of the user.

Client tools definition is an object of functions, and needs to be identical with your configuration within the [ElevenLabs UI](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai), where you can name and describe different tools, as well as set up the parameters passed by the agent.

```ts
const conversation = useConversation({
  clientTools: {
    displayMessage: (parameters: { text: string }) => {
      alert(text);

      return "Message displayed";
    },
  },
});
```

In case function returns a value, it will be passed back to the agent as a response.
Note that the tool needs to be explicitly set to be blocking conversation in ElevenLabs UI for the agent to await and react to the response, otherwise agent assumes success and continues the conversation.

#### Conversation overrides

You may choose to override various settings of the conversation and set them dynamically based other user interactions.
We support overriding various settings.
These settings are optional and can be used to customize the conversation experience.
The following settings are available:

```ts
const conversation = useConversation({
  overrides: {
    agent: {
      prompt: {
        prompt: "My custom prompt",
      },
      firstMessage: "My custom first message",
      language: "en",
    },
    tts: {
      voiceId: "custom voice id",
    },
    conversation: {
      textOnly: true,
    },
  },
});
```

#### User identification

You can optionally pass a user ID to identify the user in the conversation. This can be your own customer identifier. This will be included in the conversation initiation data sent to the server:

Tracking this ID can be helpful for filtering conversations, tracking analytics on a user level, etc.

```ts
// Or pass it when starting the session
const conversationId = await conversation.startSession({
  agentId: "<your-agent-id>",
  userId: "user-123",
  connectionType: "webrtc",
});
```

#### Text only

If your agent is configured to run in text-only mode, i.e. it does not send or receive audio messages,
you can use this flag to use a lighter version of the conversation. In that case, the
user will not be asked for microphone permissions and no audio context will be created.

```ts
const conversation = useConversation({
  textOnly: true,
});
```

#### Prefer Headphones for iOS Devices

While this SDK leaves the choice of audio input/output device to the browser/system, iOS Safari seem to prefer the built-in speaker over headphones even when bluetooth device is in use. If you want to "force" the use of headphones on iOS devices when available, you can use the following option. Please, keep in mind that this is not guaranteed, since this functionality is not provided by the browser. System audio should be the default choice.

```ts
const conversation = useConversation({
  preferHeadphonesForIosDevices: true,
});
```

#### Connection delay

You can configure additional delay between when the microphone is activated and when the connection is established.
On Android, the delay is set to 3 seconds by default to make sure the device has time to switch to the correct audio mode.
Without it, you may experience issues with the beginning of the first message being cut off.

```ts
const conversation = useConversation({
  connectionDelay: {
    android: 3_000,
    ios: 0,
    default: 0,
  },
});
```

#### Acquiring a Wake Lock

By default, the conversation will attempt to acquire a [wake lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API) to prevent the device from going to sleep during the conversation.
This can be disabled by setting the `useWakeLock` option to `false`:

```ts
const conversation = useConversation({
  useWakeLock: false,
});
```

#### Methods

##### startConversation

`startConversation` method kicks off the WebSocket or WebRTC connection and starts using the microphone to communicate with the ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent. The method accepts an options object, with the `signedUrl`, `conversationToken` or `agentId` option being required.

Agent ID can be acquired through [ElevenLabs UI](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai) and is always necessary.

```js
const conversation = useConversation();

// For public agents, pass in the agent ID and the connection type
const conversationId = await conversation.startSession({
  agentId: "<your-agent-id>",
  connectionType: "webrtc", // either 'webrtc' or 'websocket'
});
```

For public agents (i.e. agents that don't have authentication enabled), define `agentId` - no signed link generation necessary.

In case the conversation requires authorization, use the REST API to generate signed links for a WebSocket connection or a conversation token for a WebRTC connection.

`startSession` returns promise resolving to `conversationId`. The value is a globally unique conversation ID you can use to identify separate conversations.

For WebSocket connections:

```js
// Node.js server

app.get("/signed-url", yourAuthMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/get-signed-url?agent_id=${process.env.AGENT_ID}`,
    {
      headers: {
        // Requesting a signed url requires your ElevenLabs API key
        // Do NOT expose your API key to the client!
        "xi-api-key": process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
      },
    }
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    return res.status(500).send("Failed to get signed URL");
  }

  const body = await response.json();
  res.send(body.signed_url);
});
```

```js
// Client

const response = await fetch("/signed-url", yourAuthHeaders);
const signedUrl = await response.text();

const conversation = await Conversation.startSession({
  signedUrl,
  connectionType: "websocket",
});
```

For WebRTC connections:

```js
// Node.js server

app.get("/conversation-token", yourAuthMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/token?agent_id=${process.env.AGENT_ID}`,
    {
      headers: {
        // Requesting a conversation token requires your ElevenLabs API key
        // Do NOT expose your API key to the client!
        'xi-api-key': process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
      }
    }
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    return res.status(500).send("Failed to get conversation token");
  }

  const body = await response.json();
  res.send(body.token);
);
```

```js
// Client

const response = await fetch("/conversation-token", yourAuthHeaders);
const conversationToken = await response.text();

const conversation = await Conversation.startSession({
  conversationToken,
  connectionType: "webrtc",
});
```

##### endSession

A method to manually end the conversation. The method will end the conversation and disconnect from websocket.

```js
await conversation.endSession();
```

##### sendFeedback

A method for sending binary feedback to the agent.
The method accepts a boolean value, where `true` represents positive feedback and `false` negative feedback.
Feedback is always correlated to the most recent agent response and can be sent only once per response.
Check `canSendFeedback` state to see if feedback can be sent in the given moment.

```js
const { sendFeedback } = useConversation();

sendFeedback(true); // positive feedback
sendFeedback(false); // negative feedback
```

##### sendContextualUpdate

A method to send contextual updates to the agent.
This can be used to inform the agent about user actions that are not directly related to the conversation, but may influence the agent's responses.

```js
const { sendContextualUpdate } = useConversation();

sendContextualUpdate(
  "User navigated to another page. Consider it for next response, but don't react to this contextual update."
);
```

##### sendUserMessage

Sends a text messages to the agent.

Can be used to let the user type in the message instead of using the microphone.
Unlike `sendContextualUpdate`, this will be treated as a user message and will prompt the agent to take its turn in the conversation.

```js
const { sendUserMessage, sendUserActivity } = useConversation();
const [value, setValue] = useState("");

return (
  <>
    <input
      value={value}
      onChange={e => {
        setValue(e.target.value);
        sendUserActivity();
      }}
    />
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        sendUserMessage(value);
        setValue(value);
      }}
    >
      SEND
    </button>
  </>
);
```

##### sendUserActivity

Notifies the agent about user activity.

The agent will not attempt to speak for at least 2 seconds after the user activity is detected.
This can be used to prevent the agent from interrupting the user when they are typing.

```js
const { sendUserMessage, sendUserActivity } = useConversation();
const [value, setValue] = useState("");

return (
  <>
    <input
      value={value}
      onChange={e => {
        setValue(e.target.value);
        sendUserActivity();
      }}
    />
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        sendUserMessage(value);
        setValue(value);
      }}
    >
      SEND
    </button>
  </>
);
```

##### setVolume

A method to set the output volume of the conversation. Accepts object with volume field between 0 and 1.

```js
const [volume, setVolume] = useState(0.5);
const conversation = useConversation({ volume });

// Set the volume
setVolume(0.5);
```

##### muteMic

A method to mute/unmute the microphone.

```js
const [micMuted, setMicMuted] = useState(false);
const conversation = useConversation({ micMuted });

// Mute the microphone
setMicMuted(true);

// Unmute the microphone
setMicMuted(false);
```

##### status

A React state containing the current status of the conversation.

```js
const { status } = useConversation();
console.log(status); // "connected" or "disconnected"
```

##### isSpeaking

A React state containing the information of whether the agent is currently speaking.
This is helpful for indicating the mode in your UI.

```js
const { isSpeaking } = useConversation();
console.log(isSpeaking); // boolean
```

##### canSendFeedback

A React state representing whether the user can send feedback to the agent.
When false, calls to `sendFeedback` will be ignored.
This is helpful to conditionally show the feedback button in your UI.

```js
const { canSendFeedback } = useConversation();
console.log(canSendFeedback); // boolean
```
